Tutorial for bringing up a shared service cluster utilizing nomad, consul, terraform and saltstack

This spot is a tutorial for getting up and running with a nomad cluster.  For my build I will be using Terraform and SaltStack and will provide those configuraitons here although I will not provide direction on set up or configuration of either.  I will be building these resources in AWS.

This is built using the standard AWS Linux AMI.
