# nomad.bootstrap
This is intended to be a quick guide to getting started with HashiCorp's Nomad and Consul services.  I provide a mostly plug and play solution that should be helpful for understanding the basics of both services.

This documentation will be updated with more details as I go forward.  Please stay tuned.


After booting, the WFE example will be registered as a service in Consul at: boostrap-wfe-webs-frontend.service.consul.

Now that we have a running system, transition to the Step 2 branch to move on to more additions and detailed configurations.
